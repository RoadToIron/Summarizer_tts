This project is Built for the purpose of summarizing text if the text is too large it is built using huggingface hosting and models.This is an experimental project that was made to experiment with the summarization model on cloud based platform due to these models being too big to adapt on an Edge device.For future work im working on a TTS model that is hooked up with G.L.A.D.O.S Dataset to try to replicate the cunning voice of glados on the summarization app.
